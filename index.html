      <strong>MDN definition of Promise</strong>- A promise is a proxy for a
      value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to
      associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or
      failure reason.

            Decide ahead of time what has to be done when the promise is
            eventually fulfilled or rejected. That is either setting up the
            table or cooking pasta.

    <li><h4>A promise is simply an object in JavaScript.</h4></li>
    <li>
      <h4>A promise is always in one of the three states.</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong><em>pending:</em></strong> is initial state, neither fulfilled
          nor rejected.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><em>fulfilled:</em></strong> meaning that the operation
          completed successfully.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><em>rejected:</em></strong> meaning that the operation failed.
        </li>

      <h4>
        Why do we need <strong><em>'Promise'</em></strong
        >?
      </h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Promises help us deal with asynchronous code in a far more simpler way
          compared to callbacks.
        </li>
        <li>Callback hell can be avoided with Promises.</li>

      <h4>How to work with Promises?</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>How to create a Promise?</li>
        <li>How to fulfill or reject the Promise?</li>
        <li>
          How to execute callback functions based on whether the Promise is
          fulfilled or rejected?
        </li>
        <li>
          When Promise status is changed from pending to fulfilled,
          <em>then()</em> is executed.
        </li>
        <li>
          When Promise status is changed from pending to rejected,
          <em>catch()</em> is executed.

  <h2>Promise - Part II</h2>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
    <li>
      <h3><em>.then()</em> function</h3>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Chaining Promises</h3></li>
    <li>
      <h3>Promise Static Methods</h3>
      <h4><em>Promise.all()</em></h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>Promise.all()</em>: Query multiple APIs and perform some actions
          but only after all the APIs have finished loading.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <em>Promise.all()</em> method takes an iterable of promises as an
          input and returns a single Promise that resolves to an array of the
          results of the input promises.
        </li>
        <li>
          Returned promise will resolve when all of the input's promises have
          resolved, or if the input iterable contains no promises.
        </li>
        <li>
          It rejects immediately if any of the input promises reject or the
          non-promise throw an error, and will reject with this first rejection
          message/error.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4><em>Promise.allSettled()</em></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Promise.allSettled()</em> waits for all input promises to complete
          regardless of whether or not one of them is rejected.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4><em>Promise.race()</em></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Promise.race()</em> method returns a promise that fulfills or
          rejects as soon as one of the input promises fulfills or rejects, with
          the value or reason from that promise.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>async - await</h3>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: square"><strong>async</strong></li>
        <li>
          There is a way to improve it even further - by using the async/await
          keywords introduced in ES2017(ES8)
        </li>
        <li>
          The <em>async ... await</em> keywords allow us to write completely
          synchronous looking code while performing asynchronous tasks behind
          the scenes.
        </li>
        <li>The <em>async</em> keyword is used to declare async functions.</li>
        <li>
          <em>Async</em> functions are functions that are instances of the
          AsyncFunction constructor
        </li>
        <li>
          Unlike normal functions, async functions always return a promise.
        </li>
        <li style="list-style-type: square"><strong>await</strong></li>
        <li>
          <em>await</em> keyword can be put infront of any async promise based
          function to pause your code until that promise settles and returns its
          result.
        </li>
        <li>
          await only works inside async functions. Cannot use await in normal
          functions.
        </li>
